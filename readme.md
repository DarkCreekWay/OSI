# DarkCreekWay's OSI Framework (DarkCreekWay/OSI)

> OSI is the acronym for **O**perating **S**ystem **I**ntegration

Using operating system specific functions from .NET is a challenge on its own
and usually requires a lot of Interop code.

Even while there are a lot of sources and examples for interop code on the web,
most of them are only focusing on the interop calls itself, but seldom provide
a fully managed wrapper around an OS feature.

DarkCreekWay's Operating System Integration (OSI) framework is intended to close this gap and provide
fully implemented wrappers of OS specific features.
