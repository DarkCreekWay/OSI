# Microsoft Windows Registry OSI

The implementation of .NET for working with the Microsoft Windows Registry Service
is not really suited well for dependency injection and mocking scenarios.

The DarkCreekWay.OSI.Microsoft.Windows.Registry.* packages are especially
designed with testability in mind.
The packages are easy to integrate into existing projects with minimum effort.

As a bonus, you also get a set of extension methods that simplify and streamline
your work.
